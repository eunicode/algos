# My Algorithm Solutions

My solutions may not be the most elegant or efficient, but they are the results of my own mental labor. 

## freeCodeCamp

I've solved all the algorithm challenges (16 basic, 21 intermediate, 5 advanced) in freeCodeCamp's *JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures* curriculum and achieved a freeCodeCamp *Algorithms* certificate, which represents an estimated 300 hours of coursework. My solutions used to be visible in my freeCodeCamp [profile](https://www.freecodecamp.org/eunipa), but freeCodeCamp no longer stores user solutions after its major update in 2018. I still have my solutions stored locally, so I plan on transferring them here. 

## CodeWars

I've finally leveled up to 6 kyu in CodeWars! Kyu is a term borrowed from Go, a Chinese board game, and indicates the number of degrees away from master level (dan). Beginners start at 8 kyu. You can view my complete collection of solutions on my CodeWars [profile](https://www.codewars.com/users/scifishelf/completed_solutions). 

## CodeSignal (formerly known as CodeFights)

I'm also getting my feet wet in technical interview style algorithms by solving easy problems in [CodeSignal](https://codesignal.com/).
