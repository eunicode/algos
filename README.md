# My Algorithm Solutions

My solutions may not be the most elegant or efficient, but they are the results of my own mental labor.

## freeCodeCamp

I've solved all the algorithm challenges (16 basic, 21 intermediate, 5 advanced) in freeCodeCamp's _JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures_ curriculum and achieved a freeCodeCamp _Algorithms_ certificate, which represents an estimated 300 hours of coursework. My solutions used to be visible in my freeCodeCamp [profile](https://www.freecodecamp.org/eunipa), but freeCodeCamp no longer stores user solutions after its major update in 2018. I still have my solutions stored locally, so I plan on transferring them here.

## CodeWars

I've finally leveled up to 5 kyu in CodeWars! Kyu is a term borrowed from Go, a Chinese board game, and indicates the number of degrees away from master level (dan). Beginners start at 8 kyu. You can view my complete collection of solutions on my CodeWars [profile](https://www.codewars.com/users/scifishelf/completed_solutions).

## CodeSignal

I'm getting my feet wet in technical interview style algorithm challenges by solving easy problems in [CodeSignal's](https://codesignal.com/) interview practice section.

## Leetcode

Also working through Leetcode's _Top Interview Questions_, the easy collection.

## Hackerrank

I'm also dabbling in solving challenges in Hackerrank's _Interview Preparation Kit_.

## Cracking the Coding Interview

## Pramp

I'm practicing for technical interviews by pair programming on [Pramp](https://www.pramp.com/faq). Practice makes perfect!
